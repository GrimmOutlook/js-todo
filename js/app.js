// Problem: User interaction does not work
// Solution: Add interactivity so the user can manage daily tasks

// Plan: 1. Add tasks
  // When button is pressed,
  // Create a new list item with the text from #new-task
    //input (checkbox)
    //label
    //input (text)
    //button.edit
    //button.delete
    //Each of the above elements will need to be modified and appended




// 2. Edit an existing task
  //When the edit button is pressed:
    //if the class of the parent is .editMode
      //switch from .editMode
      //label text to become the input's value
    //else
      //switch to .editMode
      //input value becomes the label's text

    //Toggle .editMode on the parent




// 3. Delete an existing task




// 4. Mark a task as complete




// 5. Mark a task as incomplete
